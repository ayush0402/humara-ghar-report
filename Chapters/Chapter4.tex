he/she wants to share their room with someone else. The user can skip this section if he/she wants to live alone.
This data will be used to calculate match-score between users.\par

a room. The user can also view his/her profile by clicking on the profile icon on the top right corner of the page.

location and preferences.

\subsection{Admin Panel}
To stop spam property listings, especially for non-shared rooms, they have to go through a manual acceptance before they are shown to the public.
Currently only the project owners have admin access. The admin panel is used to view all the pending listings and accept or reject them.
