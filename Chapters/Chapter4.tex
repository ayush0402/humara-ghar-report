The second section of onboarding process aims to collect information about the user's roommate preferences in case
he/she wants to share their room with someone else. The user can skip this section if he/she wants to live alone.
This data will be used to calculate match-score between users.\par

\section{Dashboard}
The dashboard is the main page of the app. It contains various sections that will be discussed in detail in the
below.

\end{figure}

The home page has links to redirect user to main parts of the dashboard catered towards finding a roommate and finding
a room. The user can also view his/her profile by clicking on the profile icon on the top right corner of the page.

\subsection{Find Roommate}
The find roommate page contains a list of all the users that have listing themselves as looking for a shared room, so anymore already having a place to live but looking for a roommate to split
the expenses can find them. Alternatively, you can also team-up among people looking for a room and search for an empty flat together. The user can filter the list based on
location and preferences.


\subsection{Find Room}
The find room page contains a list of all the users that have listing themselves as looking for a roommate, (already having a place to live). The user can filter the list based on
location and preferences again. The rooms which are not shared are also listed here. The user can also view them.

The user can either view the detailed description of the room or the roommate by clicking the card. Or he/she can
directly mark themselves interested in the property by clicking the interested button. It will prompt the user to select
if they are interested as a team (if part of any) or individually.
